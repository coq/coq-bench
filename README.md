# Coq Bench repository is in the process of being archived

After https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/12581 [which was merged by
side-effect in https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/12816] , the coq-bench
script is maintained in the main Coq repository.

Please, head to https://github.com/coq/coq for issues and up-to-date
code. This repository will be shortly archived, once all the issues
have been closed or transferred out.

We keep the old readme below for historical purposes.

# Welcome to Coq Bench!

coq-bench is a set of scripts that allow users to track performance
changes between two different versions of Coq.

The scripts can be run on INRIA's Jenkins instance or in your own machine.

## Submitting a benchmark to INRIA's Jenkins infrastructure:

See (Jenkins Instructions)[https://github.com/coq/coq/wiki/Jenkins-(automated-benchmarking)]

Results can be seen at https://ci.inria.fr/coq/job/benchmark-part-of-the-branch/

## Contributing

Maintainer of coq-bench is Emilio Jes√∫s Gallego Arias; see the
[contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file information about contributing
to this software.

## Adding your package for testing.

- Add your package to the `coq-extra-dev` OPAM repository
  https://github.com/coq/opam-coq-archive , for that you'll need to
  submit a pull request.

- Go to the web UI
  https://ci.inria.fr/coq/view/benchmarking/job/benchmark-part-of-the-branch/configure
  and add the package to the default list. You will need admin
  privileges on the CI instance in order to do this.

## Running a bench locally:

Soon, see Travis file to see how the setup works.
